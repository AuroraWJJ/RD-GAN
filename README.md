### train
Run train_ck_faceGAN.py in the pycharm to train the model.
Run config.py to change dataset.

### test, predict
Run real_time_predict.py to make a predict, and set configuration in config.py.

### Description of other documents
1. The path of the files is in tree.txt
Different file names correspond to different functional files, you can know the function of the file by the name of the file. For example,¡®0_MMI_preprocess.py¡¯represents the preprocessing of MMI dataset. The words with 'video' or 'image' represent the processing of video or image.

2. Prime files
We define parameters in config.py, such as training times, paths, etc. See the file or the following information for details.
datasets.py is a data feeder program file that provides the datasets used for tensorflow training and constructs out-of-order inputs.
model.py is a model file that is used to construct the model of the entire network.
train_ck_facegan.py is the main program file for training ck+ data.
We make a predict of the input face in real_time_predict.py.
All the functions that operate on the files path are in the path_prcess.py.
image_process.py contains functions related to image processing, such as zooming in and out of images, linear interpolation, etc.

3. Configuration
config.py is the configuration file, the specific configuration is as follows:
    SSIM_RATIO = 1           # define parameters for SSIM
